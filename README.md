# Interviewprep

Interviewprep is a Python-based interactive interview simulator powered by the Google Gemini API. This tool helps users practice for technical interviews in various fields by asking relevant questions, providing real-time feedback on their answers, and generating a comprehensive performance summary.

* **General Interview Questions**: The tool also includes common behavioral and general interview questions, ensuring a well-rounded practice session.
* **AI-Powered Scoring & Feedback**: Leveraging the Google Gemini API, InterviewMate rates your answers based on relevance, clarity, and depth. It provides concise, actionable feedback for improvement on each answer.
* **Comprehensive Summary**: After the simulated interview, a final summary of your overall performance is generated, highlighting key areas for improvement.

## How It Works

The script operates through a streamlined process:

1.  **Field Selection**: You choose a technical field from a presented list.
2.  **Question Generation**: The script dynamically selects 10 technical questions pertinent to your chosen field and 5 general interview questions.
3.  **Answer Evaluation**: For each question, your answer (currently a simulated input) is sent to the Google Gemini API. The API, acting as an "interview expert," assigns a score (1-10) and provides single-line feedback for improvement.
4.  **Performance Summary**: All collected feedback points are summarized into 5-6 ultimate suggestions by the Gemini API, giving you a holistic view of your interview performance.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.x
* Google Gemini API Key

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/InterviewMate.git # Replace with your repo URL
    cd InterviewMate
    ```

2.  **Install the necessary Python library:**
    ```bash
    pip install google-generativeai
    ```

3.  **Configure your Google Gemini API Key:**
    Locate the line `genai.configure(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE")` in the script. Replace `"YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"` with your actual Google Gemini API key. **For security, it's highly recommended to use environment variables for your API key instead of hardcoding it.**

### Usage

1.  **Run the script:**
    ```bash
    python main.py # Or whatever you name your Python file
    ```

2.  **Follow the prompts:**
    The script will guide you to select a desired technical field for your interview practice.

3.  **Provide Answers:**
    Currently, the user input for answers is simulated within the code (`ans="Input answer from the user through their voice or speach"`). To interactively test the feedback, you can temporarily modify this line to accept keyboard input:
    ```python
    ans = input(f"Question: {i}\nYour Answer: ")
    ```
    This allows you to type your answers directly into the console.

4.  **Review your results:**
    Upon completion, the script will display your scores and the comprehensive feedback summary generated by the AI.
